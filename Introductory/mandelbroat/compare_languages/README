This directory contains C++, fortran90, perl and python code
for Mandelbrot set generation.

Makefile is provided and the c++/fortran codes can be compiled by typing
"make"

The executables and objects can be cleaned by typing
"make clean"

However, you might need to slightly edit makefile

These programs print results on the screen. Redirection of output is needed. 
Execute the programs by:

fortran:
  ./mandf > mand.dat
c++:
  ./mandc > mand.dat
perl:
  ./mandp.pl > mand.dat
python:
  ./manp.py  

A short script is provided for plotting the output. Use
"gnuplot gnu.sh"
to plot.

You can also run
  ./manp_numba.py
which uses numba to speed up the execution.

Finally,
  ./manp_dynamic.py
display mandelbrot, and have resizing capability. Just zoom-in the region, and the plot will be refreshed.
